# User's Voice Analysis Tool

## Background

In my work scenario, we handle a large volume of offline interview audio recordings from users every day. These
recordings capture usersâ€™ feedback on products or services, and our task is to extract key tags from the content, such
as points users think are well-done, areas that need improvement, and topics they are particularly focused on. This
tagging process helps facilitate subsequent data analysis and provides valuable insights for optimization and
improvement.

To streamline this process and reduce manual effort, I developed an automated tool specifically designed to extract
these key tags from audio conversations. The tool aims to simplify workflows, enhance processing efficiency, and deliver
more accurate and structured data for further analysis.
